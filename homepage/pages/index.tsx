            Everyone knows the best way to learn a language is to{" "}
            <strong>immerse yourself in it</strong>. Thanks to the Internet,
            it's now possible to do this without ever leaving your home—you can
            immerse yourself in a new language via TV series, movies, podcasts,
            and audiobooks!
          </p>

          <p>
            Knowclip is a way to make native media approachable as a
            language-learner. Its friendly interface lets you move through
            real-life dialog at your own pace. And crucially, it lets you{" "}

              concentrate on those bits you can learn to understand naturally
            </strong>{" "}
            at your current level.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is important because{" "}
            <strong>
              there's more to the immersion story than most people realize

            When it comes to immersion in a new language, it's not enough just
            to maximize your exposure to native speech. In order to actually
            learn from that speech, it must be
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>within rich context</strong>, like the plot of a story or
              the thread of a conversation

            <li>
              <strong>
                <em>just</em> beyond your current level of understanding

              .
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This way, your brain can <strong>fill in the gaps</strong> and make
            sense of new words or grammar structures almost automatically.

            What's most important is that you{" "}

            Of course, finding that content to download isn't always easy. I'm
